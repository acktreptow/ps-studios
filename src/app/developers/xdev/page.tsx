      <Paragraph>
        Formed in 2000, XDev has a unique role in PS Studios. They don&#39;t
        develop games, but instead collaborate with external studios by funding
        their development of (mostly) exclusive games for PlayStation. This
        hands-off approach means XDev ships more games than other PS Studios,
        while producing an eclectic selection from the very different
        developers.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        XDev has shipped 10 PS5 games, with 2024 being their highest yearly
        output at 4. They currently have 2 games for 2025: Action-Adventures
        &#39;Lost Soul Aside&#39; in August and June&#39;s &#39;Death Stranding
        2: On the Beach&#39;, which received an excellent 89 on Metacritic.

          <Paragraph>
            XDev&#39;s PS5 collaborations have been inconsistent. While
            2021&#39;s &#39;Destruction AllStars&#39; and 2022&#39;s
            &#39;Firewall Ultra&#39; share the lowest rated PS Studios
            Metacritic score at 62, 2024 games like &#39;Helldivers 2&#39; and
            &#39;Stellar Blade&#39; far exceeded critical and commercial
            expectations.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Recently released DS2 is however by far, their most AAA PS5 game.
            It&#39;s also a more cinematic game that PS Studios are known for,
            but due to ex-PlayStation leadership&#39;s live-service push,
            it&#39;s actually been nearly 2 years since PS Studios released one.
            Its 89 Metacritic was expected, and will likely only be surpassed by
            Helldivers 2 commercially.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lost Soul Aside looks like a great, but not industry-defining
            action-adventure. Its critical and commercial performance will
            likely be similar to Stellar Blade.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            In terms of 2026 and beyond, XDev&#39;s nature makes it hard to
            predict future games/genres. After all, no one saw Marvel T≈çkon
            coming. As long as they stay away from VR and vehicular combat,
            their PS5 history indicates that XDev games will at least be good.
