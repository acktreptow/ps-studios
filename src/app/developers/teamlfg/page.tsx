      <Paragraph>
        Announced in May 2025, the 40-person teamLFG are the newest addition to
        PS Studios. LFG stands for &#39;looking for group&#39; as they create
        games where players can find friendship and community. While the name
        foreshadows their debut game, LFG&#39;s unique history must be discussed
        first because they aren&#39;t a new studio - they were an incubation
        team within Bungie for years.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As part of Bungie, LFG worked on Destiny and Halo, but their experience
        also extends to non-shooter live-services like League of Legends and
        Roblox. This history can be seen all over their project &#39;Gummy
        Bears&#39; - a team-based action game inspired by fighters, MOBAs,
        platformers and sims. It&#39;s also set in a science-fantasy world, but
        has a light-hearted, comedic tone to distinguish itself from Destiny.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        When Gummy Bears was in internal incubation, playtest reception was more
        positive than Bungie&#39;s Marathon and word spread throughout Sony. So
        in 2024, when Bungie&#39;s financial issues meant all options were on
        the table for Sony to extract value, LFG was brought directly into PS
        Studios where they&#39;d have full control. LFG titles now have no onus
        to come to Xbox or Nintendo, whereas Bungie is multiplatform.

          <Paragraph>
            Little has been said about Gummy Bears, but gameplay details did
            leak. It&#39;s a team-based PvP MOBA with many modes and classes. GB
            is also influenced by Smash Bros to differentiate from others MOBAs,
            like players falling off maps and percentage-based damage. To appeal
            to a younger audience than Destiny, friends can also &#39;express
            their identity&#39; in a &#39;cozy vibe&#39;.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Out of Sony&#39;s upcoming live-service games, I&#39;m more
            optimistic about Gummy Bears than most - it&#39;s very telling that
            with all of Bungie&#39;s current turmoil, LFG showed enough promise
            for Sony to extract them from a bad situation and directly nurture
            GB&#39;s potential.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            GB is also the only Smash Bros type game on PS5, instead of the
            saturated shooter-focused genre Fairgames/Marathon are in. Its
            lighter tone could also be a major selling point - similar to the
            virality Helldivers 2&#39;s managed democracy achieved. Finally, GB
            launches after the aforementioned games, which gives Sony plenty of
            data to see what went right/wrong.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Nonetheless, GB is still years away, and with the volatility of
            live-service, its commercial and/or critical success can still go
            either way. Hopefully, LFG keep their word of many playtests -
            it&#39;s the best barometer of what an increasingly pessimistic
            hardcore PS5 base thinks of yet another GaaS.
