      <Paragraph>
        Founded in 1991, this Washington-based developer is the most unique
        first-party studio for a variety of reasons:
      </Paragraph>
      <List>
        <li>
          Microsoft used to own Bungie when they created Xbox&#39;s flagship IP
          &#39;Halo&#39;.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sony acquired Bungie in 2022, but they&#39;re the only first-party
          developer not in PS Studios. They&#39;re an independent Sony
          subsidiary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bungie are the only first-party developer who can port their games to
          competing platforms like Xbox.
        </li>
      </List>
      <Paragraph>
        Why does Bungie have more freedom than PS Studios? Desperation. Sony saw
        the money live-service games like Destiny were making, but had no
        in-house knowledge to make their own. For Bungie to sell, Sony overpaid
        at $3.6 billion and accepted most terms. They were meant to advise on
        Sony&#39;s other live-service games while raking in revenue from Destiny
        2, which has severely underperformed post-acquisition.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Since 2023, there&#39;s been many rounds of layoffs, Sony taking board
        seats, a migration of Bungie employers to other PS Studios, and a whole
        incubation team spun out into teamLFG under PS Studios. Essentially,
        Sony are recouping what they can from Bungie once it was clear they
        wouldn&#39;t see ROI through their live-service expertise.
      </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            On PS5, Bungie has only released a port of Destiny 2 in 2020.
            Although its final paid expansion, 2024&#39;s The Final Shape, was
            critically acclaimed, its underwhelming sales led to the hollowing
            out of Bungie and further integration into PS Studios.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Bungie also revealed Marathon, a live-service extraction shooter, in
            2023. It took until March 2025 to be showcased, with many playtests
            before its initial September 2025 release. However, Marathon was
            delayed to 2026 following tepid playtest opinion and a stolen art
            scandal.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            To call Marathon important for Bungie is an understatement. For them
            to keep any autonomy, it must do well to justify the $3.6 billion
            acquisition. However, its post-reveal issues and subsequent delay
            makes this outcome increasingly less likely, resulting in further
            changes to Bungie as Sony recoups as much as possible from the
            failed acquisition.
