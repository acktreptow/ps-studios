      <h1>Bungie</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1991, this Washington-based developer is perhaps the most
        unique first-party developer for a variety of reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are the creators of the Xbox's flagship IP in Halo and were once
          owned by Microsoft.
        </li>
        <li>
          After leaving Microsoft in 2007, they then joined Activision in 2010
          to work on Destiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are the only developer technically not part of PS Studios.
          Instead, acting as its own independent subsidiary under Sony.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are the only first-party developer who is allowed to launch all
          of their games simultaneously across competing platforms like Xbox.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reasons for the past 2 points is because Sony was desperate to bring
        in-house knowledge of live service games and even at the bloated price
        of $3.6 billion, these were stipulations in order to sell, which they
        did so in 2022.
      </p>
      <h2>My Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        So far, the only game Bungie has brought to the PS5 is a port of Destiny
        2 which launched in 2020. They have however announced their next game, a
        live-service extraction shooter called Marathon, that was announced in
        2023. We haven't seen anything since that original CG trailer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is every reason to be wary of it's quality though. Despite Sony
        paying a king's ransom for their live service knowledge, Destiny 2 has
        been severely underperforming. To the point where there were huge
        layoffs just to ensure certain targets were met that prevented a Sony
        takeover of Bungie's board. It's almost a certainty that another round
        of layoffs will occur after Destiny 2's last expansion is released. And
        even then, Sony might still be able to take over as they are bleeding so
        much money. It's hard to believe Marathon will be the game they need it
        to be under those circumstances.
