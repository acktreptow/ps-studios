      <h1>Fabrik Games</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2014, this Manchester-based developer is best known for
        developing the 2016 title &#39;Filthy Lucre&#39; as well as The Lost
        Bear for PSVR a year later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never heard of them? No problem. And you will not need to. This because
        since then, Fabrik have only been supporting another first-party
        developer in Firesprite. For example, helping with development of the
        Firesprite game &#39;The Persistence&#39; in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fabrik were officially purchased by Firesprite in September 2021 to
        bolster their manpower. With Firesprite being purchased by Sony only a
        few weeks prior, they then became an official first-party studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they are only a support studio, they have not released any PS5 games.
        Nor should you expect them to. We will hopefully hear from them soon
        whever Firesprite announce the next game they are working on.
      </p>
