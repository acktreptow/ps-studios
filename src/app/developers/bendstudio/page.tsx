      <h1>Bend Studio</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 1992, this Oregon-based developer is best known for
        developing the Syphon Filter series and Days Gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bend Studio have not released a native PS5 game yet. However, Days Gone
        did receive a 60fps patch that doubles the framerate of the PS4
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Days Gone releasing in April 2019, we still know very little
        about their next title. Here is what we do know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It will be a new IP</li>
        <li>It will be a live service game</li>
        <li>
          Bend did initially pitch Days Gone 2, which was rejected by Sony due
          to poor critical reception.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main people in charge will not be the same as the people who led
          Days Gone. This is because they lost the internal power struggle which
          occured after Days Gone launched.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will hopefully here more soon as it has already been 5 years since
        the last game. At the very least, it should be a very different game on
        the writing side, as Bends main writers are no longer with the studio.
