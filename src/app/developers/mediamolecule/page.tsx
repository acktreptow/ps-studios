      <h1>Media Molecule</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2006, this Surrey-based developer is primarily known for
        their critically acclaimed LittleBigPlanet series that launched on the
        PS3, as well as 2020&#39;s Dream for the PS4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Media Molecule has yet to release a PS5 title. In fact, we don't even
        have a name for their game, let alone gameplay, despite their last game
        releasing over 4 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever their next game is, I wouldn't expect much as the developer is
        far removed from it's heyday during the PS3 generation. Dreams wasn't
        close to a commercial success, they have lost the vast majoirty of their
        founders, and it's been reported that they were nearly close instead of
        London Studio during Sony's October 2023 layoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With rising development costs, general inflation, and the type of games
        Media Molecule make not being commercially viable, It's far more likely
        the studio will close before it releases a new game. Here's hoping I'm
        wrong, as Sony needs a diverse portfolio of first-party games that Media
        Molecule will bring.
