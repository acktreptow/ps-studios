            This Montreal-based developer was founded in 2021 by Jade Raymond -
            one of the creators of Assassin&#39;s Creed. Raymond was at Google
            beforehand, but left once they stopped supporting their cloud-based
            console &#39;Stadia&#39;.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Raymond then took this cloud infrastructure knowledge and founded
            Haven Studios, which caught the attention of Sony. They immediately
            started funding Haven&#39;s first game and acquired them a year
            later.

            This game turned out to be FairGame$. A live-service competitive
            heist shooter that will launch simultaneously on PS5 and PC.

          <Paragraph>
            We haven&#39;t seen Fairgame$ since its bare-bones CG announcement
            trailer in May 2023. But while Haven has been silent, reported
            information from trusted leakers paint a very negative picture.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In February 2025, one leaker reported that Fairgames$ was internally
            delayed from fall 2025 to Spring 2026. Then in May 2025, Sony
            announced that Jade Raymond had left Haven without saying why.
            According to a Bloomberg expos√©, even Haven staff weren&#39;t told.
            It then went on to say that Jade Raymond exited only a few weeks
            after an NDA&#39;d external playtest was not well received, which
            concerned staff about its progress. It has also been internally
            retitled to Fairgames.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Between the internal delay, Jade Raymond leaving, a poor playtest,
            Sony&#39;s cold feet in live-service post-Concord, Fairgames being
            Haven&#39;s first game, using unproven cloud tech as a key pillar,
            and the consumer&#39;s already negative opinion, it&#39;s hard not
            to be extremely pessimistic. At this point, it&#39;s far more likely
            Haven closes than Fairgames shipping to critical or commercial
            success.
