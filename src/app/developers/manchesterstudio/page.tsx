      <Paragraph>
        In 2015, Sony internally created Manchester Studio (formerly North West
        Studio) to develop AAA VR games for their PSVR headset. Their only game
        was the unannounced &#39;CSAR: Combat, Search, and Rescue&#39;, where
        the player would fly a helicopter around shooting enemies, whilst
        simultaneously rescuing rescuing civilians from them.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Unfortunately, the game&#39;s development struggled around vital
        decisions like art style and basic gameplay. Its co-lead designers also
        worked in London - only visiting the studio around once a week. When
        they were there, they&#39;d then micromanage the many prototypes. Hires
        were made in London to streamline development, but it created a further
        breakdown in communications.

      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Even with its issues, Sony left Manchester Studio alone due to the small
        30-person headcount working in a rented space. However, when Hermen
        Hulst took over PS Studios in 2019, he thoroughly reviewed the entire PS
        Studios portfolio. MS therefore underwent proper scrutiny despite cheap
        running costs, and Hulst didn&#39;t like CSAR&#39;s lack of progress
        after 5 years of development. Combined with PSVR&#39;s ending lifecycle
        due to the upcoming PS5 and PSVR2, Hulst cancelled CSAR and closed MS in
        February 2020.

          <Paragraph>
            Sony&#39;s closed 5 studios since the PS5 launched, with Manchester
            Studio closing a few months prior. But MS&#39;s closure coming first
            isn&#39;t surprising, as most in Hulst&#39;s position would&#39;ve
            done the same. By 2020, PSVR was years past its peak in popularity.
            Therefore, even if CSAR shipped, there was no money to be made from
            its guaranteed low sales.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            CSAR could&#39;ve transitioned to PSVR2, but this would mean a
            February 2023 release date at the earliest. An 8-year cycle for a VR
            game by an unproven studio with a track record of development issues
            makes no fiscal sense. Furthermore with 2025 hindsight, even a PSVR2
            version wouldn&#39;t have improved sales. Other, bigger first-party
            titles like Horizon COTM performed so poorly that PS Studios
            hasn&#39;t released a VR game since PSVR2 launched.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            It&#39;s a shame when studios close, but the unfortunate reality is
            that it made sense to shut down Manchester Studios. According to a
            post-closure expos√©, even ex-Manchester devs recognize it was the
            logical choice and don&#39;t blame Sony for pulling the plug.
