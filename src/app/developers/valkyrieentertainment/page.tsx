      <Paragraph>
        Valkyrie Entertainment are a Seattle-based developer who were founded in
        2002 and acquired by Sony in 2021.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Never heard of Valkyrie or their games? Makes sense. That&#39;s because
        Valkyrie only act as a support studio for PlayStation games developed at
        other first-party studios.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In fact despite being founded over 20 years ago, Valkyrie has only been
        the main developer on 2015&#39;s digital only &#39;Guns Up!&#39; for PSN
        and mobile, which came and went with no fanfare.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        You&#39;re far more likely to have seen their support work on titles
        from other PlayStation developers like God of War: Ragnar√∂k from Sony
        Santa Monica.

          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            This one&#39;s easy to forecast. Due to their support status,
            Valkyrie haven&#39;t released a game for the PS5.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Based off the critical and commercial failure of Guns Up!, it&#39;s
            also unlikely they&#39;ll get a chance to. Especially if their
            unsecure, bare-bones unsecure website is anything to go by.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            If you&#39;re looking for your next great first-party PS5 game to
            play, you can safely ignore Valkyrie Entertainment.
