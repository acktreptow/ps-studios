      <Paragraph>
        In 2015, Sony internally created Manchester Studio (formerly North West
        Studio) to develop AAA VR games for their PSVR headset. The only game
        they worked on was the unannounced &#39;CSAR: Combat, Search, and
        Rescue&#39;, where the player would fly a helicopter around shooting
        enemies, whilst simultaneously rescuing rescuing civilians from them.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Unfortunately, the game&#39;s development struggled with concerns around
        vital decisions like art style and basic gameplay. Its co-lead designers
        also worked in London - only visiting the studio around once a week.
        When they were there, they&#39;d then micromanage the many prototypes.
        Hires were made in London to streamline development, but that created a
        further breakdown in communications.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Even with its issues, Sony left Manchester Studio alone due to the small
        30-person headcount who worked in a rented space. However, when Herman
        Hulst took over PS Studios in 2019, MS underwent proper scrutiny despite
        the cheap running costs. As he was new to the role, Hulst thoroughly
        reviewed the entire PS Studios portfolio and didn&#39;t like CSAR&#39;s
        lack of progress after 5 years of development. Combined with the end of
        PSVR&#39;s lifecycle due to the upcoming PS5 and PSVR2, Hulst ultimately
        cancelled CSAR when he closed MS in February 2020.

          <Paragraph>
            Sony has shut down 5 PS Studios since the PS5 launched, with
            Manchester Studio actually closing a few months prior. However,
            their closure shouldn&#39;t be particularly surprising as most
            people in Hulst&#39;s position would have come to the same decision.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            By 2020, 2016&#39;s PSVR had already reached its saturation point
            and was years past its peak in popularity. Therefore, even if CSAR
            shipped, there was no money to be made due to its almost guaranteed
            lack of sales.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            CSAR could have transitioned to PSVR2, but this would mean a
            February 2023 release date at the earliest. An 8-year cycle for a VR
            game by an unproven studio with a track record of development issues
            makes no sense from a fiscal perspective. Additionally with 2025
            hindsight, even a PSVR2 version wouldn&#39;t have improved sales.
            Other, bigger PSVR2 first-party titles like Horizon Call of the
            Mountain performed so poorly that PS Studios hasn&#39;t released a
            VR game since the hardware&#39;s launch.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            It&#39;s always a shame to see people lose their jobs, but the
            unfortunate reality is that it made total sense to shut down
            Manchester Studios. According to a post-closure expos√©, even
            ex-Manchester developers recognize closure was the logical decision
            and don&#39;t blame Sony for pulling the plug.
