      <Paragraph>
        Founded in 2007, this San Diego-based developer supports games from
        other first-party with art, animation etc. As support, their
        contributions are small, but it means VASG work on 15-25 games at a
        time, in addition to Sony&#39;s non-gaming IP like Netflix&#39;s Love,
        Death & Robots. Though not the traditional role of a developer, there
        was a failed pivot to become one in 2018.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        VASG Senior Director Michael Mumbauer aspired to become a proper PS
        Studio with full creative control over a game, so 30 devs joined from
        near studios to remake a classic. 2007&#39;s Uncharted was targeted, but
        as an early PS3 game, it was too hard to modernize for PS5 at that size.
        VASG then settled on 2013&#39;s The Last of Us - a more modern PS3 game.
        Afterwards, VASG could hire up for Uncharted, then their own titles.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        TLOU&#39;s remake (Project T1X) was probationally approved, which meant
        it stayed a secret with no budget to hire up. VASG questioned Sony&#39;s
        commitment, but completed a vertical slice to showcase T1X&#39;s look
        and feel in spring 2019 - just before Hermen Hulst took over all of
        first-party. Due to his new role, Hulst thoroughly reviewed the entire
        PS Studios portfolio and grew concerned with T1X&#39;s budget. Mumbauer
        argued this was VASG&#39;s first project on a new engine and he had to
        hire up to modernize gameplay. Hulst was unconvinced.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Instead, T1X&#39;s team supported Naughty Dog&#39;s TLOU 2 after its
        delay to 2020. Once shipped, instead of hiring up, T1X shifted to
        ND&#39;s budget who joined in a support role. Mumbauer knew this would
        strip VASG&#39;s autonomy as ND outpaced VASG&#39;s work due to their
        size. As TLOU was their IP, ND were also trusted more by Sony, which
        effectively gave them final say. VASG was now jokingly referred to as ND
        South, so in late 2020, with his vision dead, Mumbauer and many on his
        team quit. VASG now continue in the support role Sony always saw them
        in.

          <Paragraph>
            Mumbauer&#39;s vision for VASG died in 2020, which made it very
            unlikely that they&#39;d ever develop their own PS5 game. Since
            then, other factors have made the chances even lower.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            A worse economy resulted in multiple rounds of layoffs at Sony and
            VASG wasn&#39;t immune. In March 2025, Bend&#39;s live-service game
            was cancelled after 4 years of development. As VASG supported the
            cancelled project, an undisclosed number of VASG staff were let go.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Circumstances could change on PS6, but this seems unlikely. Until
            then, we can at least appreciate VASG&#39;s work in most upcoming PS
            Studios games via art, animation etc. VASG are also rumored to be
            assisting Naughty Dog and a new internal studio on the next
            Uncharted. This isn&#39;t what Mumbauer envisioned, but as part of
            many projects, VASG continue to be essential to PS Studios for the
            foreseeable future.
