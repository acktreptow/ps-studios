      <h1>San Mateo Studio</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 1998, San Mateo Studio (formerly Foster City Studio) works
        out of... San Mateo, California.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a few other PlayStation first-party developers, San Mateo are only
        a support studio. They did spin off a small team in 2014 that was called
        Pixelopus, but this first-party studio was closed down in June 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to their support status, they've not released a PS5 game and it's
        incredibly unlikely they will ship one where they are the main
        developer.
