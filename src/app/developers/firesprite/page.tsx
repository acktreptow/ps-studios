      <Paragraph>
        Founded in 2012, Firesprite is a Liverpool-based developer formed by
        ex-Studio Liverpool (previously Psygnosis) employees, which Sony closed
        only weeks prior to reduce headcount in the EU. Firesprite&#39;s first
        major game was 2018&#39;s The Persistence, which launched on PS4 as well
        as Xbox One and Nintendo Switch since Sony wouldn&#39;t acquire
        Firesprite until 2021.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        So far, they&#39;ve released two PS5 games. An enhanced port of The
        Persistence in 2021 and the flagship PSVR2 launch title Horizon Call of
        the Mountain in 2023. Neither were particularly well received,
        critically or commercially. Firesprite actually has the lowest average
        Metacritic score out of the 15 PlayStation Studios developers who&#39;ve
        shipped a PS5 game.

          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            Firesprite hasn&#39;t announced anything since Horizon launched
            alongside PSVR2. Most likely due to their dire situation,
            post-acquisition.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Crunch was necessary to ship Horizon. Additionally, all but one
            founder and many other staff left once retention bonuses were paid
            out. Layoffs then took place a year later, after reports that
            Firesprite&#39;s unannounced live-service Twisted Metal game was
            cancelled.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Since then, Firesprite has been linked to a sequel to PS4&#39;s
            Until Dawn, which was remade on PS5 in 2024 and included a new
            ending teasing it. However, between layoffs, loss of leadership,
            cancellations, the remake&#39;s poor sales, and none of
            Firesprite&#39;s games receiving above 80 on Metacritic, it&#39;s
            unlikely that Until Dawn 2 will succeed commercially or critically.
