      <Paragraph>
        Team Asobi is a Tokyo-based developer that technically, was formed in
        2021. Asobi originally formed in 2012 as part of Japan Studio, but
        became independent when Japan Studio closed in 2020.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Asobi are primarily known for smaller-scoped games that focus on new
        PlayStation hardware. For example, The PlayRoom to show off the
        DualShock 4 and Astro Bot Rescue Mission for PSVR. They&#39;re are also
        one of the smallest PS Studios with a headcount at around 65.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        So far, Asobi has released 2 PS5 games, the first being 2020&#39;s
        Astro&#39;s Playroom - a free PS5 launch title that&#39;s pre-installed.
        Its gameplay was primarily developed to show off the PS5&#39;s new
        features like haptic feedback and was very well received. Even after 4
        years, it&#39;s still one of the best uses of the DualSense and the
        game&#39;s positive reception is why Asobi survived the Japan Studio
        closure.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Asobi&#39;s next game, Astro Bot, came out very recently in September 2024.
        Its nearly 4-year development cycle resulted in it being Asobi&#39;s biggest
        game to date. But most importantly, it led to an excellent 94 on
        Metacritic, making Astro Bot the highest rated game of 2024 and tying
        with God of War: Ragnar√∂k as the highest rated first-party PS5 game.

          <Paragraph>
            Despite Astro&#39;s Playroom releasing in 2020, it took until May
            2024 for Team Asobi to announce their next game, simply called Astro
            Bot - their biggest game yet which released in September.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Astro&#39;s Playroom was a great game that even after 4 years, has
            still made the best use of the DualSense. It&#39;s why Asobi
            survived the Japan Studio closure.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            It&#39;s therefore no surprise that this experience, combined with
            Astro Bot having double the development time, resulted in a 94 on
            Metacritic. Making Astro Bot the highest rated game of 2024 and
            tieing with God of War: Ragnarok as the highest rated first-party
            PS5 game.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            It&#39;s still too early for sales figures, but it&#39;s been at the
            top of sales charts worldwide. A desperately needed win for Sony
            after Concord.
