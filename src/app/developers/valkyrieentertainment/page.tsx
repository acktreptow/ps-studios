      <Paragraph>
        Valkyrie Entertainment are a Seattle-based developer who were founded in
        2002 and acquired by Sony in 2021.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Haven&#39;t heard of Valkyrie or their games? That&#39;s because
        Valkyrie only act as a support studio for games developed at other
        PlayStation first-party studios. For PS5, that&#39;s been 2022&#39;s God
        of War: Ragnar√∂k from Sony Santa Monica and 2024&#39;s ill-fated Concord
        from Firewalk.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        In fact, despite being founded over 20 years ago, Valkyrie has only been
        the main developer on 2015&#39;s digital only &#39;Guns Up!&#39; for PSN
        and mobile. It was a commercial failure and only received 54 on
        Metacritic.

          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            This one&#39;s easy to forecast. Due to Valkyrie Entertainment&#39;s
            status as a support studio, they haven&#39;t shipped their own PS5
            game.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Based off the critical and commercial failure of Guns Up!, it&#39;s
            also unlikely they&#39;ll ever get a chance to. Especially if their
            unoptimized, bare-bones website is anything to go by.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            If you&#39;re looking for your next great first-party PS5 game to
            play, you can safely ignore Valkyrie Entertainment.
