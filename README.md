# ps5studios.com

Welcome to [ps5studios.com](https://www.ps5studios.com)! A site that provides a comprehensive overview of all the first-party developers part of PlayStation Studios during the PS5 generation.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js (Next.js 14 App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (For deployment and hosting)
- Hostinger (For domain registration)

## Project Overview

I had 2 goals for this project:

1. To get hands-on experience with Next.js
2. To create a product that even the general public with no interest in coding would find interesting and enjoy using.

Both of these goals were achieved.

#### Tech-Focused Goal

For the first, more tech-focus goal, I have coded a feature-rich Next.js application that includes, but is not limited to the following:

- **Server Components:** Creating as many server components as possible for optimized server-side rendering.
- **App Router:** Utilizing the app router for numerous, often nested pages.
- **Next.js Components:** Using components like Image & Link.
- **SEO Optimization:** Ensuring correct metadata throughout, along with a sitemap and robots file for server-side SEO.
- **React Features:** Implementing features you'd find in a regular React app, like custom components and high-order functions to keep the code DRY.
- **TypeScript:** Maintaining type-safety throughout to ensure clean code.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Using Tailwind CSS to create an engaging, responsive UI/UX for mobile, tablet and desktop.

#### User-Focused Goal

For the second goal, the average video games player would learn a lot from ps5studios.com due to its 5 sections:

1. **The homepage**, which contains clickable logos of all 22 PlayStation first-party developers that will take you to their own page. This way, the viewer can know every single PlayStation developer before even interacting with the site.
2. **Developers section**: Each page provides a brief history of a PlayStation developer, analyzes the games they've already released on the PS5 (if any at all), and whether or not they hold a unique position under the PlayStation Studios umbrella. I also provide my own analysis and predictions on what you can expect from each studio for the remainder of the PS5 generation. Such as predicting what their next game is and its release window.
3. **PS5 Games section**: This section provides a list of every released and upcoming PS5 game from PlayStation Studios with even more granular data about each one. The user can sort the games by Metacritic score or by release date to analyze the information from various different angles.
4. **Stats section**: This is where the analysis goes many layers deep to provide a number of stats for each first-party developer and the PlayStation Studios umbrella as a whole. They range from basic ones like how many PS5 games each developer has released, to more complex ones like which developer's has the highest average Metacritic score.
5. **About section**: This goes into more detail about all the pages, as well as why I felt this site was necessary to create.

Overall, this was one of the most fulfilling projects I have worked on. It not only significantly improved my Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind skills, but it's also an engaging and informative website that stands on it own outside of the coding world.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/ps-studios.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ps-studios`
3. Type `npm install` into the command line to ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Type `npm run dev` into the command line to view it in your preferred browser

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ways you can do so:

- Forking the repo and creating a new branch with your feature.
- Letting me know what other stats you would like me to include.
- If you're interested in helping me convert this into a React Native app.

## Contact

If youâ€™d like to contribute, have questions, or want to provide feedback, please reach out to me at [alex@treptow.dev](mailto:alex@treptow.dev)

## Future Enhancements

The website will be periodically updated whenever new information about PlayStation Studios comes out.

I don't plan on any significant changes in regards to the code, but have left the door open if a contributor comes up with a great idea or if they're willing to collaborate on converting the website into a native mobile app.
