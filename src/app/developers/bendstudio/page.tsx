      <Paragraph>
        Founded in 1992, this Oregon-based developer is best known for their
        Syphon Filter series on PS1, PS2 and PSP. They&#39;ve also developed
        spin-off games from IP created at other first-party studios, like
        Uncharted: Golden Abyss (Naughty Dog) and Resistance: Retribution
        (Insomniac).

      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Bend&#39;s last game was 2019&#39;s Days Gone on PS4, which got
        remastered on PS5 in April 2025. This native PS5 re-release includes
        resolution and framerate upgrades, a new horde mode, and other small
        elements like a PS5 trophy list.

          <Paragraph>
            Despite Days Gone shipping over 6 years ago, there&#39;s a reason
            why we don&#39;t even have a name for Bend&#39;s next game. It&#39;s
            been a very long string of bad luck:
          </Paragraph>
          <List>
            <li>
              Bend pitched Days Gone 2, which Sony rejected due to the initial
              reception of Days Gone.
            </li>
            <li>
              A 2020 internal power struggle resulted in the writer and creative
              director leaving.
            </li>
            <li>
              This led to new leadership greenlighting a live-service game
              within a new IP.
            </li>
            <li>
              The game was then cancelled in January 2025. Likely due to Sony
              leadership&#39;s cold feet in live-service post-Concord.
            </li>
          </List>
          <Paragraph>
            Fortunately, much of DG&#39;s criticisms stem from those who lost
            the power struggle. Between that, Sony&#39;s new-found reluctance in
            live-service, DG getting a remaster, and the more positive general
            consensus around the IP in 2025, there&#39;s a good chance Days Gone
            2 could now be greenlit and launch to much better critical
            reception.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            This would be the best case scenario, but don&#39;t expect it until
            PS6. Meaning out of all PS Studios, Bend will go the longest without
            releasing a new game. Due to ex-leadership and Sony&#39;s poor
            live-service execution, the PS5 has been a truly wasted generation
            for Bend.
