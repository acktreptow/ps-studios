      <h1>Housemarque</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1995, this Finnish-based developer has released over 10
        different IP on PlayStation consoles since 2007. This includes Super
        Stardust, Resogun, and Matterfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their most recent game is 2021's Returnal for the PS5, which took many
        of the rouge-like elements seen in their previous titles, but were able
        to now reach more mainstream demographic with a change to a third-person
        shooter and more emphasis on a high-production value story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly Sony were happy with the outcome as they purchased Housemarque
        within 2 month's of Returnal's release.
      </p>
      <h2>My Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Returnal is the only game Housemarque have released on the PS5, and
        despite it releasing over 3 years ago, we don't even have a title for
        their next game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, there's every reason to be excited about whatever it is.
        Housemarque proved they could put their difficult rouge-like bona fides
        into a more mainstream package with Returnal. Now with this new
        experience under their belt, plus the backing of Sony as an official
        first-party developer, their next game should improve on this new
        formula. It has been 3 years though, so we should (hopefully) hear about
        it soon.
