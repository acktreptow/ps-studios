      <SubTitle subtitle="History" />
      <Paragraph>
        Team Asobi is a Tokyo-based developer that technically, was formed in
        2021. They actually formed in 2012 within Japan Studio, but became
        independent when JS closed. With a small headcount of around 65, Asobi
        develop smaller games that showcase new PlayStation hardware. Like
        2013&#39;s The PlayRoom for DualShock 4 and 2018&#39;s Astro Bot Rescue
        Mission for PSVR.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        So far, Asobi has released 2 PS5 games. 2020&#39;s Astro&#39;s Playroom
        was a free, pre-installed PS5 launch title with gameplay showcasing new
        PS5 features like haptic feedback. Even after 4 years, it&#39;s still
        one of the best uses of the DualSense. The game&#39;s positive reception
        is also why Asobi survived Japan Studio&#39;s closure.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Asobi&#39;s next game, Astro Bot, launched in September 2024. This near
        4-year development cycle resulted in it being Asobi&#39;s biggest game
        to date. But most importantly, it led to monumental critical and
        commercial success that no one saw coming.

        <div>
          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            Critically, Astro Bot achieved a 94 on Metacritic, making it the
            highest rated game of 2024 and tying GoW: Ragnar√∂k as the highest
            rated first-party PS5 game. Astro Bot is also the most awarded
            platformer ever and won Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards.
            Commercially, it&#39;s sold 2.5 million, is part of PS5 bundles, and
            is the first title to have multiple themed DualSenses.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Considering its $50 million budget, Astro Bot has made $10+ million
            in profit - even with its many free DLCs. So whatever Asobi want to
            do next, Sony unlikely says no. Though I predict Asobi stick to the
            blueprint and release a worthy sequel at the end of PS5&#39;s
            lifecycle in 2027/28.
