      <p>
        Founded in 2002 and officially purchased by Sony in 2021, this
        Seattle-based developer acts as a support studio for other first-party
        titles being developed by other PlayStation Studios.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact despite being around for over 20 years, the only game they were
        the main developer on was 2015's digital only game "Guns Up!", which
        came and went with no fanfare. You're far more likely to see their
        support work on huge titles like God of War: Ragnarok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valkyrie have therefore not released any games for the PS5 and it's
        highly likely they won't ever. Especially if their unsecure barebones
        website is anything to go by.
