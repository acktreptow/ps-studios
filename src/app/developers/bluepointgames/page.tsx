      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2006, this Texas-based developer is primarily known for its
        excellent remasters and remakes. The majority of which are from Sony's
        firrst-party IP. These include remastering God of War 1 and 2 to the PS3
        and Uncharted 1-3 to the PS4.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only non-Sony IP remaster was MGS 2 and 3 to both the PS3 and Xbox
        360. However, they have provided support on other non-PlayStation
        products such as the Xbox 360 version of Titanfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bluepoint's most recent projects have however been full-on remakes that
        include Shadow of the Collossus on PS4 and most recently, Demon's Souls
        on the PS5. This was a launch title for the PS5 and was highly praised.
        We have haven't even gotten the name of their next game despite it being
        over 3 years later.
      </p>
      <h2>My Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The only thing we know about their next game is that it's 'original
        content'. However, despite know very little, there is every reason to be
        confident. Bluepoint Games have an excellent track record and do have
        some experience working on original content as a suppoer studio for Sant
        Monica's God of War: Ragnarok.
