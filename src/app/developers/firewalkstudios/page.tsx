      <h1>Firewalk Studios</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2018, this Washington-based developer is led by developers
        with significant experience in popular multiplayer shooter IP such as
        Halo and Destiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this speciality and Sony's increased focus to expand their
        multiplayer portfilio this generation, it's no surprise that they
        officially joined PlayStation Studios in 2023 and unveiled its debut
        project: Concord. A live-service PVP shooter with an 80's sci-fi
        aesthetic that will launch on PS5 and PC in 2024.
      </p>
      <h2>My analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Everything we know about Concord is written above, so suffice to say we
        don't have a lot to go off. Nonetheless, the pedigree of the developers
        before the creation of Firewalk is enough for you to be excited about
        Concord. As the game is still scheduled for a 2024 release, we should
        hopefully see something more concrete soon.
      </p>
