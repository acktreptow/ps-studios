      <h1>Insomniac Games</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1994, this California-based developer was basically a
        PlayStation exclusive developer for decades before being officially
        purchased by Sony in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because the 3 main franchises they were originally known for in
        Spyro, Ratchet & Clank and Resistance were all exclusive to Sony
        platforms and funded by them. It was only when the latter two IP started
        to flounder in the PS3 generation when the developer branched out with
        games by EA, Xbox Game Studios and Oculus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The developer would find their footing again with 2018's Spider-Man that
        ended up being the highest-selling Sony game during the PS4 generation.
      </p>
      <h2>My analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This is an easy one - they've been by far, the most important
        first-party developer during the PS5 generation and the vast majority of
        people would agree. This is because they've already released 4 games, 2
        of which were new Spider-Man games, that all released to critical and
        commercial success.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even though Insomniac have released 4x the amount of titles compared
        to many other Sony developers, we already know their next game will be.
        Marvel's Wolverine that will most likely release in 2025. Between the
        pedigree they've proven with Marvel properties through Spider-Man and
        the huge leaks that unfortunately were released, it's safe to say that
        this game will be another huge critical and commercial hit for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really can't see them not being the most important first-party
        developer for the PS5 generation when all is said and done.
      </p>
