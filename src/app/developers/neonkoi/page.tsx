      <h1>Neon Koi</h1>
      <p>
        Neon Koi is a German-Finnish developer that was founded in 2020 under
        their initial name - Savage Game Studios. It was in fact under this old
        name when they originally purhcased by Sony in August, 2022.

      <p>
        In regards to their PS5 output, they haven't released anything, nor
        should you expect them to. This is because Neon Koi are a founding
        member of PlayStation Studios' Mobile Division and were purchase with
        the sole intent to create mobile games.

        However, if you're still interested in their mobile offerings, I still
        wouldn't hold my breath. They've yet to even announce a game let alone
        show gameplay or release one. In fact, Neon Koi's only times in the news
        were for negative headlines. For example, when the head of the Mobile
        Divison left, which was quickly followed up by a founding member leaving
        under suspicious ciorcumstances as well.

        The last time they were in the news was when the developer officially
        changed the name to Neon Koi in November 2023. With this change and a
        revamped website, hopefully it means we get a game announcement soon. We
        can then start determining if Neon Koi and PlayStation's Mobile Divison
        as a whole are worth keeping an eye on.
