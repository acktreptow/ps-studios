      <Paragraph>
        Neon Koi was a German-Finnish developer that was founded in 2020 under
        the name &#39;Savage Game Studios&#39;. It was under this initial name
        when Sony acquired them in August 2022.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        When it comes to Neon Koi&#39;s PS5 output, they didn&#39;t release
        anything. That&#39;s because they were a founding member of PlayStation
        Studios&#39;s Mobile Division and acquired to exclusively develop mobile
        games.

          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            Still interested in their mobile offerings? Well, don&#39;t hold
            your breath as Neon Koi was shut down in October 2024. And despite
            forming over four years before closure, Neon Koi didn&#39;t even
            announce a game, let alone show gameplay or actually ship something.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In fact, Neon Koi was only known for negative headlines. Like when
            the head of PlayStation&#39;s Mobile Division and an SGS founder
            abruptly quit under suspicious circumstances, or the failed
            rebranding to Neon Koi in 2023.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            At best, Neon Koi will be remembered as an insignificant footnote in
            PlayStation&#39;s history during the PS5 era â€” and at worst, as a
            glaring example of the mistakes made by former PlayStation
            leadership. From short-sighted, poorly researched acquisitions to
            wasted spending on games that were cancelled before they were even
            announced, NK embodies the missteps of the Jim Ryan era.
