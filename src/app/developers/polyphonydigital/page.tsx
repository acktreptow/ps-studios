            Founded internally by auteur Kazunori Yamauchi in 1998, this
            Tokyo-based developer is known for PlayStation&#39;s best-selling
            IP, the Gran Turismo sim racing series, which has sold over 100
            million copies.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            At least one GT has shipped on every PlayStation console. For PS5,
            that&#39;s 2022&#39;s critically and commercially acclaimed Gran
            Turismo 7, which is not only seen as the superior competitor to
            Xbox&#39;s Forza Motorsport, but is also viewed as the premier PSVR2
            experience.

          <Paragraph>
            It takes around 4-5 years for Polyphony to release a new GT these
            days, so I predict we&#39;ll see GT8 close to the end of the PS5
            gen. If you&#39;re a fan, I&#39;d be even more excited this time too
            - GT8 should be PS5 only and take an even further graphical leap on
            PS5 Pro. They&#39;ve also learned from GT7&#39;s launch issues,
            which will improve the gameplay loop.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Never played GT or are a lapsed fan? It might be worth trying
            2024&#39;s &#39;My First Gran Turismo&#39;. Polyphony describe it as
            a &#39;free-to-play beginner-friendly introduction to the world of
            GT&#39;. Basically, an expanded demo with a limited number of cars
            and racetracks.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Otherwise, I would look to other PS Studios for your next
            first-party game. There&#39;s no confirmation Polyphony&#39;s next
            game is GT8, but it&#39;s a safe bet considering their track record.
