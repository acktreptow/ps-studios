      <Paragraph>
        Pixelopus was a California-based developer internally formed in 2014
        under unique circumstances. In 2012, Thatgamecompany&#39;s released PS3
        indie adventure Journey to critical and commercial acclaim. This
        inspired Sony&#39;s Foster City Studio (now San Mateo Studio) to fund
        small development teams and emulate this success.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        One university they funded was Carnegie Mellon, who they gave PS Vitas
        to experiment with. 6 students were hired, along with 3 from San Jose
        University and 2 industry vets to form Pixelopus. That same year, they
        released Entwined for PS3, PS4 and Vita. The twin-stick rhythm title
        shadow-dropped at Sony&#39;s 2014 E3 showcase but only received tepid
        critical and commercial success.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
        Pixelopus followed Entwined with 2019&#39;s Concrete Genie on PS4. This
        award-winning action-adventure was heavily inspired by Jet Set Radio and
        street art, but like Entwined, it wasn&#39;t a commercial hit. It was
        also Pixelopus&#39;s final game, as Sony shuttered them in 2023.

          <SubTitle subtitle="My Analysis & Predictions" />
          <Paragraph>
            It&#39;s unsurprising Sony shut Pixelopus as their single-player DNA
            clashed with the 2020-23 live-service push. But in 2025, it&#39;s
            clear with games like Concord that the initiative failed - resulting
            in consequential gaps between first-party titles. Like Japan Studio
            who shut in 2021, Pixelopus would be more useful now than in 2023 as
            their smaller games would help fill these gaps.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            However, closing Pixelopus can still be justified. Unlike Japan
            Studio, their legacy amongst PlayStation fans is non-existent. JS
            games don&#39;t sell millions, but do provide utility that goes
            beyond money as they keep the hardcore base engaged. Whereas
            Pixelopus games not only don&#39;t sell, but aren&#39;t evangelized
            as a brand differentiator despite the awards.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph marginBottom={8}>
            Pixelopus&#39;s expensive San Mateo location further makes it hard
            to justify keeping open in this economy, and their cancelled PS5
            game was a licensed IP in partnership with Sony Animation, which
            would incur extra fees/red tape. Considering these factors, even
            with Sony&#39;s failed live-service push, closing Pixelopus is still
            a logical conclusion.
